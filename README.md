# 2048 Game by Eduard Herasym

DESCRIPTION
This is a web-based implementation of the popular puzzle game "2048" created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them, resulting in a tile with the number 2048. The game continues until no more moves can be made, or the player reaches the 2048 tile.

FEATURES
 - Responsive Design: The game is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
 - Scoring System: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as tiles are combined.
 - Game Over Detection: When the game is over (i.e., no more valid moves), the player is notified, and they can choose to restart the game.
 - Simple and Intuitive UI: The user interface is straightforward and easy to understand, with clear instructions on how to play.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
 - HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
 - CSS(SCSS): Used for styling the game elements and layout.
 - JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the game state.

HOW TO PLAY
 - Desktop: Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move tiles.
 - Combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers.
 - Keep combining tiles to reach the 2048 tile and achieve the highest score possible.
